In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.





class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        
        int arr[] = new int[n+1];

        for(int i = 0;i<trust.length;i++)
        {
            arr[trust[i][1]]++;
            arr[trust[i][0]]--;
        }

        for(int i = 1;i<arr.length;i++)
        {
            if(arr[i]==n-1)return i;
        }   
        return -1;

    }
